433PiRemote
===========

This is web interface for remote switches.
It has two parts: an user interface with simple buttons and an administration part
with fancy forms and dip switches that enables everyone to add new remote switches.

Please use composer to install all dependencies as it needs the twig emplate engine.

    composer install
    
    
You will also need the 433-sender-server. I will upload it to github in few days.
